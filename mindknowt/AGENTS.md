# MindKnowt — working rules

Product spec: `mindknowt-v1-spec.md` in `gabbyvonigas/mindknowt`. Build order is
section 7. Steps 2 (NFC) and 4 (AlarmKit) are proven on hardware.

## Before claiming anything works

Run `npm run verify` — typecheck plus a real iOS bundle. A change is not done
until it passes.

Config changes need `npx expo config --type introspect` as well. That is the
only way to see the Info.plist and entitlements prebuild will actually
generate; reading `app.json` is not the same thing.

Then say plainly what was verified and what was not. **Passing is not the same
as working on device.** NFC and AlarmKit cannot be exercised anywhere but a
physical iPhone — never describe them as working because they compiled.

## Read the source; do not infer behavior

`docs.expo.dev` is blocked by this environment's network proxy. Read the
installed package instead: `node_modules/<pkg>`, including its native
`ios/*.swift` / `ios/*.m` and its `app.plugin.js`.

Both real bugs so far were found this way, and neither would have been found by
reasoning about what the library probably does:

- Requesting `NfcTech.FelicaIOS` silently enabled ISO18092 polling, which iOS
  rejects unless the app declares FeliCa system codes in Info.plist. Every scan
  failed instantly, before a tag was ever involved.
- `expo-alarm-kit` returns `"authorized"` immediately without prompting when
  permission already exists, which is what makes a mount-time read safe.

## When a report contradicts your explanation, the explanation is wrong

Do not explain a symptom away. Do not call something cosmetic before reading
the code. Twice the user's correction was the thing that located the bug, after
a confident wrong answer. Go read the relevant source first, then answer.

## Errors must never be opaque

Third-party errors are frequently constructed with an empty message, so
`String(err)` renders as the useless string `"Error"`. Always preserve the
error's class name. A failure that reaches the UI without identifying itself is
a bug in its own right, independent of whatever caused it.

## The app can be relaunched by an alarm

Dismissing an AlarmKit alarm relaunches the app, so React state resets to its
initial values. Never render state that was assumed rather than read from the
system, and re-read launch payloads on foreground transitions as well as mount.

## Do not clobber the user's files

`app.json` carries `extra.eas.projectId` and `owner`, written by `eas init` on
their machine. `package.json` carries `expo-dev-client`. Neither exists in a
scratch copy of this project.

Always review `git diff --cached` before committing. A copied file that drops
either one silently breaks their build.

## Platform config lives in app.json

This is a CNG project — there is no `ios/` directory. Third-party READMEs give
Xcode instructions, which do not apply; translate them into `app.json`
(`ios.infoPlist`, `ios.entitlements`, `ios.deploymentTarget`) so prebuild
generates them.

`ios.deploymentTarget` is `26.1` because the `expo-alarm-kit` podspec requires
it. The App Group in `ios.entitlements` must match `APP_GROUP_ID` in
`src/alarms/types.ts` exactly.

## Native vs JS changes

A JS-only change hot-reloads over Metro in seconds. Anything that adds or
changes a native module needs a fresh `eas build`, which costs the user ~20
minutes. Always state which kind a change is.

## Platform boundaries

`react-native-nfc-manager` is imported in exactly one file, and
`expo-alarm-kit` in exactly one file, each behind an interface in
`src/*/types.ts`. Both third-party modules are young; keeping callers ignorant
of them is deliberate. Do not import either outside its implementation file.
